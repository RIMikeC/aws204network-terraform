#  *****      CHANGE FREEZE     *****
---
### The change freeze lasts until 12th November

#### During this time, no changes should be made to the IT infrastructure, unless itâ€™s to fix an incident.
#### This is to ensure our IT estate remains stable and working at optimum level as we move into peak trading.

Any critical changes that fall within this change freeze will need to be reviewed by the RI Tech Service Delivery Team.
